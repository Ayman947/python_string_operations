** In this project, we created string operations functions:




## Finding the nth Occurrence of a word in a string!


  - This function takes in the substring, the string, the no. of occurrence
  - Then returns back the index of the predetermined occurrence
  





## Simple String Match


  - This function takes in two string
  - The first one may include asterisk
  - Then returns if the asterisk is equivalent to the its corresponding characters in the second string or not
  (i.e do they match or not? ) 






## Is a palindrome?

  - This function takes in a text 
  - Then asserts if it can be read from both sides the same way or not?






## Repeated Substring


   - This function takes in a string
   - Then searches for the repeated substring
   - Then returns the number of repeatitions
